## INSTALLATION 
Duration: 10:00

**1. Get Community Edition script**

Download ONLYOFFICE script file using the direct link:
```sh       
$ wget http://download.onlyoffice.com/install/opensource-install.sh
```
**2. Running Community Edition Installation**
Please note that to perform  all  installation  actions you must be logged in with root rights.

**2.1** Run the complete ONLYOFFICE installation:
```sh
$ bash opensource-install.sh -md "yourdomain.com"
```
Specify your registered domain name instead of  "yourdomain.com".

In case you don’t want or don’t need to install Mail Server, run the following command:
```sh
$ bash opensource-install.sh -ims false
```
**2.2** After you have initiated running a script, you will have to choose one of the installation options depending on your needs:

Install with Docker [Y/N/C]?

* Select 'Y' to install ONLYOFFICE using Docker.

This option is recommended, if you want to install Community Edition including Community, Document and Mail servers at once. Docker script will set up Docker containers with all the modules and dependencies necessary for Community Edition correct work and is easy to run, manage and update.

* Select 'N' to install it using DEB package.

The script will automatically install and configure all the necessary prerequisites as well as Community Edition components (Document Server and Community Server). Please note, that in case you select DEB installation, you will need to manually install Mail Server and  connect it to your ONLYOFFICE installation. See instructions in [our Help Center](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/server/docker/mail/connect-mail-server-to-community-server-via-portal-settings.aspx).
